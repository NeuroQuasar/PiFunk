# PiFunk Radio Transceiver for CB and PMR446 
Early Experimental! 

(based on PiFM/AM-Script)

get it with : 
gitclone https://github.com/silicator/pifunk

cd pifunk
make clean
make

compile with:
gcc -lm -std=c99 pifunk.c -o pifunk 

run with admin/root permissions:
sudo pifunk sound.wav 100.0000 22500 fm callsign

Radio works with *.wav-file with 16-bit @ 22500.0 [Hz] mono / 1-500.00000 MHz frequency-range. 
Use '. dot' as decimal-comma seperator! 

Arguments: [filename] [freq] [samplerate] [mod (fm/am)] [callsign (optional)] 

[menu] as step-by-step-asistent
or [help] for more infos 

Pi oparates with square-waves (Â²/^2) PWM on GPIO 4 (Pin 7 @ ~500 mA)
Use power supply with enough specs only!
Use Low-/Highbandpassfilters and/or ~10 uF-caps and resistors/diodes if needed.
Check laws of your country! Do not produce transsions on permitted frequencies.
You can try to smooth it out with 1:1 baloon or dummyload 50W @ 50 Ohm for testing.
